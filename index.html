	<p>First rule of the modern web, I think, is to never voluntarily leave any personal 
	information on the internet, specifically on social media infinite scrollable brainrot 
	chambers. Because it will certainly get used against you without your explicit consent, that's 
	a given. I usually go by the alias szqmpc. It's not meant to be spelled, it's just a 
	random string of characters I came up with.</p>
	<p>These are some random stream of <a href="updates.html">thoughts</a> I think are worth 
	writing about, I'd try to be useful but updates are not categorised and that's their intended 
	behaviour.</p>

	
	  <p>Things I want to learn:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>The absolute bare minimum (fundamentals)</li>
	<li>Detailed problem-solving</li>
	<li>Basic hands-on understanding of core concepts</li>
	<li>Serious industrial-grade engineering and graduate level theory skills</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Have questions, comments or want to report errors? Reach out: <code><b>szqmpc</b> [at] 
	gmail [dot] com</code>. I'd be more than happy to respond, provided they're not spam. I
	prefer plain ASCII text email, though I'm fine with html email as well.</p>
