	<p><b>(Feb 15th, 2026)</b> What kind of morons write about themselves and talk to themselves
	  too fucking much? I'd tell you that, those who don't have anybody else to talk to. Fucking
	  stoics used to write entire books to themselves, manuscipts and thousand page monographs
	  only meant to be read in private. They wouldn't publish it, some of them ordered their
	  assistants to burn their works after they're dead. Simple yet profoundly agonizing. </p>
	<p>Another fucking paragraph of pure fucking misery.</p>
