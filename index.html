	<p><b>NOW</b>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEET">NEET</a>. Trying to become a 
	wageslave. Prepping for some govt exams. North Indian living near Kanpur. Also interested
	in independent technical RnD.</p>

	<p>First rule of the modern web, I think, is to never voluntarily leave any personal 
	information on the internet, specifically on social media that's really just actually infinite 
	scroll-able brainrot, encouraging more algorithmic bloodsport from bigcorp. Because it will 
	certainly get used against you without your explicit consent, that's a given. I usually go by 
	the alias szqmpc. It's not meant to be spelled, it's just a random string of characters I came 
	up with.</p>

	<p>These are some random stream of <a href="updates.html">thoughts</a> I think are worth 
	writing about, I'd try to be useful but updates are not categorised and that's their intended 
	behaviour.</p>

	<p>Still figuring out this web stuff. I don't know about you but my shitty K-12 education and 
	even worse college experience (which I ended up dropping out of) combined with a broken family 
	and illerate toxic parents, somehow you just keep on going while wanting to kill yourself 
        is a pretty near schizo-turning line of events. At this point you're on the brink of 
	insanity, quite really on the verge of suicide. Disturbing as it sounds, it's true. 
	</p>

	<p>You start valuing the basic facts of life, the kind of shit that makes you question 
	everything, specifically abstract bullshit like "wisdom". That's been my introduction to 
	"The Real World" where people KILL, RAPE and LIE because they think it's fun and oh, don't get 
	me wrong, many openly admit to it.
	</p>

	<p>Lots of really cool programs can be found on the internet and not all of them are impossible 
	to understand or require dark fucking magic. Not every piece of software is metamorphic 
	malware written by some god. Some of it though, does require insane amounts to work to take apart 
	and study the real (raw bytes) machine code. That is rarely the case, by the way. Not everyone 
	wants to audit their own firmware, for example. That'd be very impressive if one can, reverse 
	engineers and binary analysts with decades of experience pull it off like it's one of their daily 
	chores, it's only a dream for mere mortals.
	</p>

	<p>However, some computer literacy is always good. Not fancy algorithms, just the bare
	fundamentals that make up the foundation of modern bloated towers of abstraction, though 
	majority of it we don't really need. UI/UX people can kill themselves. Yes I really feel they 
	should not exist. Frameworks upon frameworks are the reason we fell into ruin as soon as we 
	became too reliant on big fat libraries. UNAUDITABLE PILE OF FUCKING POOP!!!
	</p>

	<p>I also really hate FOSS extremists (unix greybeards) that fuel those shitty holy wars like
	  they fucking own Intel and make their own hardware. They obviously don't. The modern
	  computers are clearly a capitalist miracle made possible by microsoft and Intel. FOSS commies 
	  who moan for fucking source code and datasheets, who can't understand how binaries/malware 
	  work, should be beheaded by reverse engineers. That'd be once in a lifetime event to see! Very 
	  satisfying, indeed. Like become a binary lover or die :P
	</p>

	<p>Some software I use:</p>
	<ul>
	    <li>Operating systems: Windows is fine. Learn how hypervisors work and microsoft
	      officially lets you run linux VMs in hyper-V (their virtualization stack) when
	      you need them.
	    <li>Text editors: Hate me for me but I'm an Emacs fan, I think it's great software.
	    <li>Email clients: Anything that lets you read and write plain ASCII text emails is
	      fine. I personally like Mutt and Claws Mail.
	    <li>PDF readers: Zathura and Okular are nice.
	    <li>Standalone sandboxes: Firejail and Sandboxie-plus.
	    <li>Compiler and binary-hacking suite: LLVM
	    <li>Browser: Firefox
  	  </ul>
	<p>That about covers it.</p>

	<p>I'm a simple dude, I like to keep my affairs in plain text files as often as I
	    can long as I can. I like to keep the code in their separate files and just link to
	    them when I want to quote a part of it or some function rather than using the <code>pre</code> 
	    tag from the web standards or some fancy LaTeX or Troff features. Even images, most of the
	    time I just to avoid them so that I don't have to learn more exotic CSS featuers. But I love 
	    vector graphics and I'm only just beginning to understand their beauty. Part
	    of the reason for doing some things is to avoid doing multiple things at once
	    and end up not having done well even one of them. Modern kids love to multitask I
	    guess but I'm sure they're aware of the hidden footguns associated with trying to do
	    too many things at once. I, however, can't focus on more than, if I try really hard, two
	    things at once. That's upper limit for me, after than I go crazy, like real crazy. That's
	    how dumb I am, BAHHHH!!!
	</p>

	<p> We like algorithmic poison and call it <em>content</em>. Things were not always this bad in the 
	    part of the world I grew up. People had real life meetups and made real friends instead of 
	    indulging in suicidal ideation that is state of modern communities on shitter and pisscord. 
	    I miss forums. Discourse is nice, btw. The last four or five years have been disastrous for 
	    me. Fixing and getting back to normal will take a lot of work, I guess. I'll do my best to 
	    not go crazy. Don't ever pursue your fucking dreams, it's a trap. </p>

	<p>Instead of gooning I think a more healthy addiction would be solving puzzles and varied
	    kinds of puzzles. Steganography and file formats is a good field to study from computer
	    security.
	</p>

	  <p>Things I want to learn:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>The absolute bare minimum (fundamentals)</li>
	<li>Detailed problem-solving</li>
	<li>Basic hands-on understanding of core concepts</li>
	<li>Serious industrial-grade engineering and (some) graduate level theory skills</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Have questions, comments or want to report errors? Reach out: <code><b>szqmpc</b> [at] 
	gmail [dot] com</code> or IRC (I'm the same guy on Libera). I'd be more than happy to 
	respond, provided they're not spam. I prefer plain ASCII text email, though I'm fine with 
	html email as well.</p>
