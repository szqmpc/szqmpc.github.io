	<p><b>NOW</b>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEET">NEET</a>. Trying to become a 
	wageslave. Prepping for some govt exams. North Indian living near Kanpur. Also interested
	in independent technical RnD.</p>

	<p>First rule of the modern web, I think, is to never voluntarily leave any personal 
	information on the internet, specifically on social media infinite scrollable brainrot 
	chambers. Because it will certainly get used against you without your explicit consent, that's 
	a given. I usually go by the alias szqmpc. It's not meant to be spelled, it's just a 
	random string of characters I came up with.</p>
	<p>These are some random stream of <a href="updates.html">thoughts</a> I think are worth 
	writing about, I'd try to be useful but updates are not categorised and that's their intended 
	behaviour.</p>
	<p>Still figuring out this web stuff. I don't know about you but my shitty K-12 education and 
	even worse college experience (which I ended up dropping out of) combined with a broken family 
	and illerate toxic parents and somehow you just keep on going while wanting to kill yourself 
        is a pretty near schizo-turning line of events. At this point you're on the brink of 
	insanity, quite really on the verge of suicide. Disturbing as it sounds, it's true. 
	</p>
	<p><b>NOW</b>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEET">NEET</a>. Trying to become a 
	wageslave. Prepping for some govt exams. North Indian living near Kanpur.</p>
	<p>You start valuing the basic facts of life, the kind of shit that makes you question 
	everything, specifically abstract bullshit like "wisdom". That's been my introduction to 
	"The Real World" where people KILL, RAPE and LIE because they think it's fun and oh, don't get 
	me wrong, many openly admit to it.
	</p>
	<p>Lots of really cool programs can be found on the internet and not all of them are impossible 
	to understand or require dark fucking magic. Not every piece of software is metamorphic 
	malware written by some god. Some of it though, does require insane amounts to work to take apart 
	and study the real (raw bytes) machine code. That is rarely the case, by the way. Not everyone 
	wants to audit their own firmware, for example. That'd be very impressive if one can, reverse 
	engineers and binary analysts with decades of experience pull it off like it's one of their daily 
	chores, it's a dream for mere mortals.
	</p>
	<p>However, some computer literacy is always good. Not fancy algorithms, just the bare
	  fundamentals that make the foundation for the modern bloated towers of abstract that
	  we're so used to, though majority of it we don't really need. UI/UX people can kill
	  themselves. Yes I really feel they should not exist. Frameworks upon frameworks are
	  the reason we fell into ruin as soon as we became too reliant on big fat libraries.
	  UNAUDITABLE PILE OF FUCKING POOP!!!
	</p>
	<p>I also really hate FOSS extremists (unix greybeards) that fuel those shitty holy wars like
	  they fucking own intel and make their own hardware. They obviously don't and then they
	  start moaning like three-year old girls like someone stole their candy. The modern
	  computers are clearly a capitalist miracle dominated by microsoft and intel in the PC
	  industry. FOSS commies who moan for fucking source code and datasheets, who can't
	  understand how binaries/malware work, should be beheaded by reverse engineers. That'd
	  be once in a lifetime event to see! Very satisfying, indeed.
	</p>
	<p>Some software I use:</p>
	<ul>
	    <li>Operating systems: Windows is fine. Learn how hypervisors work and microsoft
	      "officially" lets you run linux VMs in hyper-V (their virtualization stack) when
	      you need them.
	    <li>Text editors: Hate me for me but I'm an Emacs fan, I think it's great software.
	    <li>Email clients: Anything that lets you read and write plain ASCII text emails is
	      fine. I personally like Mutt and Claws Mail.
	    <li>PDF readers: Zathura and Okular are nice.
	    <li>Standalone sandboxes: Firejail and Sandboxie-plus.
	    <li>Compiler and binary-hacking suite: LLVM
	    <li>Browser: Firefox
  	  </ul>
	<p>That about covers it.</p>
	<p>I'm a simple dude, I like to keep my affairs in plain ASCII text files as often as I
	    can spare them. Yes! I like to keep the code in their separate files and just link to
	    them when I want to quote a part of it or some function rather than using the <code>pre</code> tag
	    from the web standards or some fancy LaTeX or Troff features. Even images, most of the
	    time I just to avoid them so that I don't have to learn more exotic CSS featuers. Part
	    of the reason for doing these sort of things is to avoid doing multiple things at once
	    and end up not having done well even one of them. "Modern" kids love to multitask I
	    guess but I'm sure they're aware of the hidden footguns associated with trying to do
	    too many things at once. I, however, can't focus on more than, if I try really hard, two
	    things at once. That's upper limit for me, after than I go crazy, like real crazy. That's
	    how dumb I am, BAHHHH!!!!
	</p>
	<p>It's jus that tech-brainrot has consumed most of our generation. We like algorithmic poison and
	    call it "content". Things were not always this bad in the part of the world I grew up.
	    The last four or five years have been disasterous for me. Fixing and getting back
	    to normal will take a lot of work, I guess. I'll do my best to not go crazy.</p>
	<p>Instead of gooning I think a more healthy addiction would be solving puzzles and varied
	    kinds of puzzles. Steganography and file formats is a good field to study from computer
	    security :P
	</p>
	  <p>Things I want to learn:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>The absolute bare minimum (fundamentals)</li>
	<li>Detailed problem-solving</li>
	<li>Basic hands-on understanding of core concepts</li>
	<li>Serious industrial-grade engineering and (some) graduate level theory skills</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Have questions, comments or want to report errors? Reach out: <code><b>szqmpc</b> [at] 
	gmail [dot] com</code> or IRC (I'm the same guy on Libera). I'd be more than happy to 
	respond, provided they're not spam. I prefer plain ASCII text email, though I'm fine with 
	html email as well.</p>
