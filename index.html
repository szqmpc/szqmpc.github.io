	<p><b>(Feb 18th, 2026)</b> It's the state of limbo where you're in your head, you know 
	what you need to do but you can't bring yourself to do it. You've given up on life but
	there's a part of you that wants to keep trying. The action that you take creates the 
	life that you live and you get so caught up in wanting, wishing, all this kind of stuff 
	that you don't act. You've to have a whole scale transformation of your life which is 
	surprisingly easier than people think it is. In your early 20s or late 20s, the only 
	things he does are the things he used to do and does them less and less. He's built an 
	entire worldview around his neurosis. I need some time to think, constantly revisits 
	increasingly skewed memories of the past wondering what he should have done instead. 
	Fixated on things no one actually remembers, probably not even to him at this point. 
	I can't do anything, defeatist who can never quite give up, only boring people get 
	bored that's me. Slowly becoming actually the R word (retard), so let's call it 
	cognitive decline. It was always going to be like this, closest thing to fun or new 
	experiences are ELABORATE FANTASIES, where he reimagines redoing his entire life centered 
	around girls he barely knew in like middle school. </p><p>Family are the only thing that's 
	keeping him alive. Knows what a schizo is but doesn't know if he is one. If I could do 
	it, I would have by now, no one chooses this. Yeah I was thinking about doing that. Knows 
	it's not too late but wishes it WAS. It only hurts when I laugh, goes months at a time 
	without laughing or sincerely smiling in constant pain. Either neet or wageslave, both 
	equally hopeless. It's not like things can get worse, Um accidentally once felt a moment 
	of relief, has been upset about it since and it's not like things can get better. 
	Developing health problems but justify a crappy lifestyle. Why should I do anything? 
	Cannot accept what he's done is nothing, does nothing in response. He exists in a state 
	of living death, thinking the same thoughts over and over, day in and day out. Even as 
	he understands that thinking doesn't help and he needs to just ACT instead. He's 
	completey overwhelmed by inertia while life passes him by. He's lost everything but can't 
	let go of anything. No reason to live, no reason to die. No reason. Haunted by vague dusty 
	delusions of megalomania. The self-loathing man of inaction. Definitely relatable to Notes 
	From The Underground by Dostoevksky. Anyway.
	</p><p>The goal of research is creation of new knowledge and more importantly, research 
	grounded in down-to-earth humble engineering aims to de-bloat, refactor and simplify 
	existing knowledge.</p>
	<p>Focus on the fundamentals.</p>
	<p>The absolute bare minimum essentials, the basic building blocks of elementary knowledge 
	grounded in simple numbers, down-to-earth language concepts and discrete mathematics. Some 
	fundamental EE and physics basics will be super helpful for engineering and modelling the 
	real world and application of theoretical scientific knowledge.
	</p>
	<p>Rather than moaning about not having the source code, shouldn't we try to develop
	  expertise in binary analysis? or learn reverse engineering? Analyzing machine code
	  gives us a (pretty good) understanding of what is actually executing on the CPU
	  when we run the program (dynamic analysis). What is "intended" to execute is often
	  not clear even if we have the source code in a high level language. So, directly
	  looking at binaries (static analysis) and trying to observe their behavior while
	  they're running or just running them and seeing what happens is much more natural way
	  to get an understanding of the program we're interested in analyzing.
	</p>
	<p><b>(Feb 17th, 2026)</b> It's tech-brainrot has consumed most of our generation. We like
	algorithmic poison and call it "content". Things were not always this bad in the part of 
	the world I grew up. The last four or five years have been disasterous for me. Fixing and 
	getting back to normal will take a lot of work, I guess. I'll do my best to not go crazy.
	Instead of gooning I think a more healthy addiction would be solving puzzles and varied 
	kinds of puzzles. The kind of puzzles that turn one into a hardworking scientist or 
	engineer. I'm also not a big fan of putting personal pictures for CV or an academic webpage 
	on the internet. I believe if you'e famous enough, somebody would create a wikipedia entry 
	for you without you asking them for it :P That however goes without saying that the internet 
	is full of predators and it's better to keep your personal info offline. Web- pages are for 
	sharing technical information, whether it be text, pictures, code, math or other media 
	files. Steganography and file formats is a good field to study from computer security.
	</p>


	<p><b>(Feb 16th, 2026)</b> Algorithms have become too good at keeping people hooked to 
	their brainrot consuming advanced glowing touchscreen fragile blackbox rectangles that
	we can't escape their grip even if we want to, even if we try our best. STEM research
	has long been weaponized against the working class and it's so depressing to be 
	somewhat aware of these immoral developments that have become the plague of modern
	societies. AI and previously the dot boom are living day examples of the kinds of 
	engineering development that are purposefully used to control the masses. It's 
	everywhere and they'd most likely never be able to escape it even if they desperately
	want to, it's a terrifyingly serious realization of scientific discovers by big-corp
	engineers to enslave us. Our attention is all they need, and they get to steal it. 
	They're stealing it as you're reading this blog. They're stealing it from the last 30 or
	so years. We're helpless, we're dumb. They've weaponized our own neurophysiology and more
	broadly psychology AGAINST us. It's a nightmare.
	</p>

	<p><b>(Feb 15th, 2026)</b> What kind of morons write about themselves and talk to themselves
	  too fucking much? I'd tell you that, those who don't have anybody else to talk to. Fucking
	  stoics used to write entire books to themselves, manuscipts and thousand page monographs
	  only meant to be read in private. They wouldn't publish it, some of them ordered their
	  assistants to burn their works after they're dead. Simple yet profoundly agonizing. </p>
	<p>Another fucking paragraph of pure fucking misery. Why the hell is life so fucking
	  depressing? Kyu hain itni udasi mere dil mein? Ab algorithmic feeds se mujhe nafrat ho
	  chuki hain. Fucking shitter and pisscord, absolute brainrot chambers. Hype mein hum kyun
	  believe kartein hain?
	</p>
	<p>Tu bolta tha ki tere basics aur fundamentals saare gayab hain, tujhe abstraction aur
	  complication cheeze ke barein mein baat karke khud ko smart dikhana dusro ke saamne bahut
	  pasand hain even if tujhe khud hi pata nhi ki tu kya bol raha hain. Teri khud ki basic
	  samaj aur common sense zero hain. Tujhe khud ki intellectual abilities pe bahut ghamand
	  hain. Tu un self-proclaimed expert chutiyo mein se ek hain zinhe understanding se koi
	  matlab nhi bas kuch bhi internet influenced backchodi karke smart feel karne se matlab
	  hain. Tu ek pretentious wannabe smart fellow hain jo (at the same time) ek bahut bada
	  chutiya hain reality mein. Tujhe elementary arithmetic bhi dhang se nahi aati, teri
	  counting ki understanding bhi almost non-existent hain. Tujhe basic algorithms like
	  division ka koi sahi idea nhi hain. Teri basic vocabulary aur english alphabet ki
	  knowledge below average hain aur tu (bhen ke lode) khud ko professor samjhta hain kyuki
	  tune bade-bade 4-5 syllables ke words ratt liye hain. Delulu se bahar aaja madarchod,
	  abhi bhi time hain. Bada hoja abtoh, chote nunnu waale. Bhen ke doodh dabana band kar
	  de, madarchod.
